I live in the tundra oasis of Minneapolis, MN, where I keep busy playing outdoors (bike, ski, soccer, canoe), hanging out in coffee shops, tinkering, farming, cooking, and cavorting with friends. 

My primary interests are computers and agriculture. While the two may seem quite distinct, I am constantly trying to find ways to connect the two. I began programming when I was working on a farm in New Hampshire, and have since been ideating on ways to integrate technology into ecologically intensive farming systems. The unusual intersection of interests means that I spend a good amount of my free time playing with Spark Cores and thinking about how trees can become part of the Internet of Things, a.k.a. the 'Internet of Trees'.

**Computers**: I am currently employed by [18F](http://18f.gsa.gov), a civic cunsulting agency within the [General Services Administration](http://www.gsa.gov/). I specialize in JavaScript, specifically AngularJS and Node.js, but I am skilled with Backbone.js, Ember.js, and proficient with Python and Ruby (on Rails). 

**Ag**: I am on the Leadership Team for [Sandbox Center for Regenerative Entrepreneurship](http://sandboxcenter.com), a farm incubator organization located in the Twin Cities. I raise pigs and garden in the summer at my friend's land in Ham Lake, MN.

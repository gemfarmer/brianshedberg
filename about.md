I live in the tundra oasis of Minneapolis, MN, where I keep busy playing outdoors (bike, ski, soccer, canoe), hanging out in coffee shops, tinkering, farming, cooking, and cavorting with friends. 

I am a developer and a farmer, and while the two disciplines seem quite distinct, I am constantly trying to find ways to connect the two. I began programming when I was working on a farm in New Hampshire, and have since been ideating on ways to integrate technology into ecologically intensive farming systems. The unusual intersection of interests means that I spend a good amount of my free time playing with Spark Cores and thinking about how trees can become part of the Internet of Things, a.k.a. the 'Internet of Trees'.

**Developer**: I am currently employed by [18F](http://18f.gsa.gov), a civic cunsulting agency within the [General Services Administration](http://www.gsa.gov/). I specialize in JavaScript, specifically AngularJS and Node.js, but I am skilled with Backbone.js, Ember.js, and proficient with Python and Ruby (on Rails). 

**Farmer**: I am on the Leadership Team for [Sandbox Center for Regenerative Entrepreneurship](http://sandboxcenter.com), a farm incubator organization located in the Twin Cities. I raise pigs and garden in the summer at my friend's land in Ham Lake, MN.

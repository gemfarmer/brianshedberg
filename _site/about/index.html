<p>I live in the tundra oasis of Minneapolis, MN, where I keep busy playing outdoors (bike, ski, soccer, canoe), hanging out in coffee shops, tinkering, farming, cooking, and cavorting with friends.</p>

<p>My primary interests are computers and agriculture. While the two may seem quite distinct, I am constantly trying to find ways to connect the two. I began programming when I was working on a farm in New Hampshire, and have since been ideating on ways to integrate technology into ecologically intensive farming systems. The unusual intersection of interests means that I spend a good amount of my free time playing with Spark Cores and thinking about how trees can become part of the Internet of Things, a.k.a. the ‘Internet of Trees’.</p>

<p><strong>Computers</strong>: I am currently employed by <a href="http://18f.gsa.gov">18F</a>, a civic cunsulting agency within the <a href="http://www.gsa.gov/">General Services Administration</a>. I specialize in JavaScript, specifically AngularJS and Node.js, but I am skilled with Backbone.js, Ember.js, and proficient with Python and Ruby (on Rails).</p>

<p><strong>Ag</strong>: I am on the Leadership Team for <a href="http://sandboxcenter.com">Sandbox Center for Regenerative Entrepreneurship</a>, a farm incubator organization located in the Twin Cities. I raise pigs and garden in the summer at my friend’s land in Ham Lake, MN.</p>

##Nice Ride Microsite

The Nice Ride Microsite project was a collaborative project between [Nice Ride](https://www.niceridemn.org/), the [City of Minneapolis](http://www.minneapolismn.gov/), [Clockwork Active Media](http://www.clockwork.net/), and [Hedberg Maps, Inc.](http://hedbergmaps.com/), sponsored by [Allina Health](http://www.allinahealth.org/). I was part of the Hedberg Maps Inc. team for the project, but collaborated with the folks at Clockwork as well.

Check out the site [here](http://parks.niceridemn.org/).
